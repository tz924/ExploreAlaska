  <string name="wildlife_intro_moose_text">Moose are relative newcomers to the Alaska Peninsula.
        They have been observed since the early 1900s, but did not become abundant until the 1950s. Moose are most readily seen from the air in winter, when there is snow on the ground.</string>

  <string name="experience_intro_glacier_text">Seeing icy glaciers is a quintessential Alaskan experience. Here are the most popular glaciers and the best ways to see them.</string>
  <string name="experience_title">01                                                      Matanuska Glacier: Hike or Drive</string>
  <string name="experience_text_1">Just a 2.5-hour drive from Anchorage, the Matanuska Glacier sits off the scenic but less-traveled Glenn Highway. More than four miles wide at its terminus, Matanuska is so massive that the water flowing out of its snout forms the roaring Matanuska River.</string>
  <string name="experience_text_2">To see the glacier, you can just take one of the pullouts all along the highway ‚Äîeach with great photo ops‚Äîor you can drive near the glacier‚Äôs edge for up-close photos. One qualifier: Access to the glacier is on private land, so there‚Äôs a $30 fee.</string>
  <string name="park_intro_text">This vast landscape does not contain any roads or trails. Visitors discover intact ecosystems where people have lived with the land for thousands of years. Wild rivers meander through glacier-carved valleys, caribou migrate along age-old trails, endless summer light fades into aurora-lit night skies of winter. It remains virtually unchanged except by the forces of nature.</string>
